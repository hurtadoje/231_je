The fourth line opens a dictionary containing the relevant data for the defined genes in the define enzymes in all three defined organisms. All dictionaries were generated using the script above, including the previously-defined dbentrez method. The first three dictionaries were generated separately instead of together due to timeout errors from NCBI that I keept encountering whenever the script ran longer than roughly 5 minutes and the database of interest was 'enzymes'.
